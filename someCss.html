        <h1>Newbie</h1>
        <h3>Paragraphs with different fonts:</h3>
        <p style="font-family:courier;">There were greenhouses, too, but they are all broken now.

            There was some legal trouble, I believe, something about the heirs and co-heirs; anyhow, the place has been empty for years.
            
            That spoils my ghostliness, I am afraid; but I don’t care—there is something strange about the house—I can feel it.</p>

        <p style="font-family:verdana;">I’m feeling ever so much better! I don’t sleep much at night, for it is so interesting to watch developments; but I sleep a good deal in the daytime.

            In the daytime it is tiresome and perplexing.
            
            There are always new shoots on the fungus, and new shades of yellow all over it. I cannot keep count of them, though I have tried conscientiously.
            
            It is the strangest yellow, that wallpaper! It makes me think of all the yellow things I ever saw—not beautiful ones like buttercups, but old foul, bad yellow things.</p>

        <h3>Pictures with size 50 x 50:</h3>

        <h1>Apprentice</h1>
        <h3>Text centered on an image:</h3>
        <div class="container" style="position: relative; text-align: center; color: white;">
        <img src = "4.jpg" style="width:500px; height:500px;">
            <div class="centered" style="position: absolute; top: 50%; left: 50%; transform: translate(-50%, -50%);">Hello World!</div>
        </div>

        <h3>20px margin around a picture:</h3>
        <img src = "2.jpg" style="margin-top: 100px; margin-bottom: 100px; margin-right: 150px; margin-left: 80px;">
        
        <h3>Text with a border that uses dotted lines</h3>
        <p style="border-style: dotted; font-family:courier;">I really have discovered something at last.

            Through watching so much at night, when it changes so, I have finally found out.
            
            The front pattern does move—and no wonder! The woman behind shakes it!
            
            Sometimes I think there are a great many women behind, and sometimes only one, and she crawls around fast, and her crawling shakes it all over.</p>
